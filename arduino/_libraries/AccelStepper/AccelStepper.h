/// \mainpage AccelStepper library for Arduino
///
/// This is the Arduino AccelStepper library.
/// It provides an object-oriented interface for 2 or 4 pin stepper motors.
///
/// The standard Arduino IDE includes the Stepper library
/// (http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Stepper) for stepper motors. It is
/// perfectly adequate for simple, single motor applications.
///
/// AccelStepper significantly improves on the standard Arduino Stepper library in several ways:
/// \li Supports acceleration and deceleration
/// \li Supports multiple simultaneous steppers, with independent concurrent stepping on each stepper
/// \li API functions never delay() or block
/// \li Supports 2 and 4 wire steppers, plus 4 wire half steppers.
/// \li Supports alternate stepping functions to enable support of AFMotor (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library)
/// \li Supports stepper drivers such as the Sparkfun EasyDriver (based on 3967 driver chip)
/// \li Very slow speeds are supported
/// \li Extensive API
/// \li Subclass support
///
/// The latest version of this documentation can be downloaded from 
/// http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper

/// \class AccelStepper AccelStepper.h <AccelStepper.h>
/// \brief Support for stepper motors with acceleration etc.
///
/// This defines a single 2 or 4 pin stepper motor, or stepper moter with fdriver chip, with optional
/// acceleration, deceleration, absolute positioning commands etc. Multiple
/// simultaneous steppers are supported, all moving 
/// at different speeds and accelerations. 
///
/// \par Operation
/// This module operates by computing a step time in microseconds. The step
/// time is recomputed after each step and after speed and acceleration
/// parameters are changed by the caller. The time of each step is recorded in
/// microseconds. The run() function steps the motor if a new step is due.
/// The run() function must be called frequently until the motor is in the
/// desired position, after which time run() will do nothing.
///
/// \par Positioning
/// Positions are specified by a signed long integer. At
/// construction time, the current position of the motor is consider to be 0. Positive
/// positions are clockwise from the initial position; negative positions are
/// anticlockwise. The curent position can be altered for instance after
/// initialization positioning.
///
/// \par Caveats
/// This is an open loop controller: If the motor stalls or is oversped,
/// AccelStepper will not have a correct 
/// idea of where the motor really is (since there is no feedback of the motor's
/// real position. We only know where we _think_ it is, relative to the
/// initial starting point).
///
/// The fastest motor speed that can be reliably supported is 4000 steps per
/// second (4 kHz) at a clock frequency of 16 MHz. However, any speed less than that
/// down to very slow speeds (much less than one per second) are also supported,
/// provided the run() function is called frequently enough to step the motor
/// whenever required for the speed set.
