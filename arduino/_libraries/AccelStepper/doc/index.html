<h1>AccelStepper library for Arduino</h1>
<p>
This is the Arduino <a class="el" href="classAccelStepper.html" title="Support for stepper motors with acceleration etc.">AccelStepper</a> library. It provides an object-oriented interface for 2 or 4 pin stepper motors.<p>
The standard Arduino IDE includes the Stepper library (<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Stepper">http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Stepper</a>) for stepper motors. It is perfectly adequate for simple, single motor applications.<p>
<a class="el" href="classAccelStepper.html" title="Support for stepper motors with acceleration etc.">AccelStepper</a> significantly improves on the standard Arduino Stepper library in several ways: <ul>
<li>Supports acceleration and deceleration </li>
<li>Supports multiple simultaneous steppers, with independent concurrent stepping on each stepper </li>
<li>API functions never delay() or block </li>
<li>Supports 2 and 4 wire steppers, plus 4 wire half steppers. </li>
<li>Supports alternate stepping functions to enable support of AFMotor (<a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library">https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library</a>) </li>
<li>Supports stepper drivers such as the Sparkfun EasyDriver (based on 3967 driver chip) </li>
<li>Very slow speeds are supported </li>
<li>Extensive API </li>
<li>Subclass support</li>
</ul>
The latest version of this documentation can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper">http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper</a><p>
Example Arduino programs are included to show the main modes of use.<p>

Tested on Arduino Diecimila and Mega with arduino-0018 &amp; arduino-0021 on OpenSuSE 11.1 and avr-libc-1.6.1-1.15, cross-avr-binutils-2.19-9.1, cross-avr-gcc-4.1.3_20080612-26.5.<p>

<dl class="user" compact><dt><b>Revision History</b></dt><dd></dd></dl>
<dl class="version" compact><dt><b>Version:</b></dt><dd>1.0 Initial release<p>
1.1 Added speed() function to get the current speed. <p>
1.2 Added runSpeedToPosition() submitted by Gunnar Arndt. <p>
1.3 Added support for stepper drivers (ie with Step and Direction inputs) with _pins == 1 <p>
1.4 Added functional contructor to support AFMotor, contributed by Limor, with example sketches. <p>
1.5 Improvements contributed by Peter Mousley: Use of microsecond steps and other speed improvements to increase max stepping speed to about 4kHz. New option for user to set the min allowed pulse width. Added checks for already running at max speed and skip further calcs if so. <p>
1.6 Fixed a problem with wrapping of microsecond stepping that could cause stepping to hang. Reported by Sandy Noble. Removed redundant _lastRunTime member. <p>
1.7 Fixed a bug where setCurrentPosition() did always work as expected. Reported by Peter Linhart. Reported by Sandy Noble. Removed redundant _lastRunTime member. <p>
1.8 Added support for 4 pin half-steppers, requested by Harvey Moon</dd></dl>
