"The Space beyond me"
Apparatus for reviving spaces that are captured in celluloid.
A collaboration between Julius von Bismarck (http://www.juliusvonbismarck.com/) 
and Andreas Schmelas (http://www.andreas-schmelas.de/).

Arduino Applications:

"SensorBoard": application for polling the rotatry sensor and the color photo sensors. (using Arduino UNO) 
"SceneManager": main application for driving the stepper motors with the motion data stored into the progmem. (using Arduino MEGA 2560)

using arduino rc 1.0 (arduino.cc)
